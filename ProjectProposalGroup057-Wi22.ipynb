    "This project will focus on investigating the effects of widespread viruses on age stratification. We picked the viruses H1N1 from 2009, SARS from 2002, and COVID-19 from 2019 as examples that may represent a bigger picture. As students of this age who have gone through all three pandemics, we are curious to find out if any of the 3 pandemics have had an impact on age stratification by comparing the population structure data during the pandemics with the population structure data from years preceding the pandemics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The outbreak of SARS in 2002 lasted for about 6 months, the outbreak of H1N1 in 2009 lasted for about a year and a half, and the outbreak of COVID-19 in 2019 has continued till this day for about 2  years. The disease with the most serious impact on demographics among the three is most likely COVID-19, followed by H1N1, then SARS. However, it may only appear so because the outbreak of COVID-19 lasted for the longest period of time. Additionally, although rising death cases are obvious to see and everyone probably had heard of the quarantine babies joke, it is unclear that these factors are significant enough to lead to a change in the age stratification of our population. Therefore, we as a group would like to conduct further research and analysis to investigate this potential correlation.\n",

    "This article suggests that it is hard to draw a conclusion about whether or not and how COVID-19 pandemic will affect human population structure since we are still experiencing this pandemic. However, it is expected to see several changes in the structure of the human population because of the deaths caused by SARS-Cov2, drop of birth rate, and social-economical changes caused by the pandemic, etc.\n",

    "This article introduces the potential demographic effects of COVID-19 pandemic on the human population. It suggests that, just like other natural disasters, the birth rate will at first drop severely, followed by a slow and gradual increase, and at last a drastic baby boom (Ullah et al., 2020). The result of this research paper could potentially support our idea that pandemics may change age stratification of the US population to some extent.\n"

    "We anticipate that all three viruses may affect age stratification; among all 3 of these viruses, we speculate that covid-19 would have the greatest effects on age stratification. We believe that the birth rate per 100,000 residents during covid-19 would be the highest among three since people were quarantined at home for a longer period of time. However, we believe that the covid-19 would have the highest infection rate due to various variants and end up with the highest death rate per 100,000 residents."

Do not judge each other. Summarizing areas of agreement and disagreement, and ask the other person if they agree with your assessment. Revise your assessment until you all agree on areas of conflict. Create a plan to resolve each conflict.\n",

    "- We divided the work into four categories: collecting data (2 people), analyzing the data (2 people), converting the content of the data into a chart using python (3 people), and finding conclusions through the chart (3 people). Everyone should be assigned three of the four categories, but other than that everyone must read each section carefully, check grammar and help revise the code and text.\n",
    "- When dealing with non-cooperative team members, we should first try to get in touch with them, try to find out the reason they do not cooperate(ex. if any difficulties are met). Try to communicate with them in a friendly manner. If all the methods mentioned above do not solve the problem, send the detailed information about this circumstance to Professor.\n"
